# Project-Issue-Tracker-Final-Projec
This project is for my Java Full Stack developer Bootcamp final 
Deliverable: A Java web application developed using Spring Boot
A complete working application is due by Wednesday, 6/22/22, at midnight.
Grading will be done through the case study development phase and conclude after the final presentation on Friday, 6/24/22. This will be done by appointment. 
Your instructor will schedule practice presentation sessions before the final presentation during the case study development phase.
All learner should present their case studies individually on Thursday, 6/23/22, and Friday, 6/24/22. Fellow learners, instructors, and visitors will be in the audience. Your instructor will schedule the presentation slot for you.


.
Technical Requirements:
Application naming format for canvas submission: LastName_FirstName_ProjectName_CaseStudy
Use Tomcat as the webserver
Views:
Use an external CSS stylesheet (internal styling may be used along with frameworks such as Bootstrap, but you must still include and utilize a custom CSS external file)
Your application should include six different views/pages (wireframes of the pages should be submitted with the project)
Use HTML to layout the pages and Thymeleaf to make the pages dynamic (frameworks such as Angular or React can be used as well but will not be covered in the course. The application’s presentation must meet the general view requirements.)
Use CSS to style the web pages
Use at least one JavaScript script linked from an external script file (internal scripts may be used along with frameworks such a jQuery, but you must still include and utilize a custom JavaScript external file)
Include a navigation section that is included across multiple pages


Models and Database:
The configuration file must be set up correctly (e.g., persistence.xml or application.properties)
Include at least three custom queries
Test each custom query created in each repository
Test at least one method in each of the service classes
Include at least one parameterized test
Include at least one test suite
Use MariaDB as your DBMS
Have at least four models along with tables in a relational database (if four models/tables do not make sense for your application, discuss this with your instructor)
Include a schema diagram of the tables
Use Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) directly or through Spring Data JPA
Include and implement repository and service classes/interfaces
Models should be annotated for binding using Spring data binding through Jakarta and/or Hibernate validation
Your application should include at least one example of each of the CRUD operations
Use JUnit to perform unit tests on the JPA repositories/services

Spring
Use Spring Boot to implement the project
Include at least two ways of creating a managed bean/object
Use correct implementations of dependency injection with appropriate use of the @Autowired annotation
Include at least one example of session management (Spring Security can be used for session management)
Apply exception handling where required by the code
Use of Web Services (when applicable)
Include sign up and login functionality with encrypted passwords using bcrypt (use of Spring Security will satisfy this requirement)
The project package structure should be shown in class where the models, DAO/repositories, services, controllers, exceptions, etc., have a package. Views or templates don’t require a package.
Standard Java naming conventions should be followed:
Classes should be written in Pascal case
Variables, methods, and URLs should be written in camel case
Files, including view files, should be written in snake case
Packages should be in all lowercase with each word separated by dots (.)
Packages should include the name of your project and your name (e.g., “org.johndoe.myprojectname”)
Each class should include comments to describe the class and the methods (see Java - JavaDoc discussion topic in Canvas)
Have the project hosted on GitHub with a “readme” file documenting user stories and technical challenges along with how they were resolved.
